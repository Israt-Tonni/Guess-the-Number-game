# Guess-the-Number-game
It is a game where the user needs to guess a number. 
To play the game, simply run the guess_number() function. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100, and you will have 7 tries to guess the number. 
After each guess, the game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low, and will give you a congratulatory message if you manage to guess the number within 7 tries.
